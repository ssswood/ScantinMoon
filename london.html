<h1>Tim and Sarah's London Tips!</h1>

<h2> Museums</h2>

<h4> <strong> Tim: </strong> My favourite museum in London is the <strong> British Museum</strong>. I just love the displays, the range, the sheer scale. They have the Rosetta Stone! The Rosetta Stone!! Their Ancient Egypt section is mind blowing as is their Greek collection from the Acropolis. If you go, please play this game - imagine that the museum will give you a gift of one item - what would you choose? </br></br>

The <strong>Tower of London</strong> is great. I note it appears on your list of gifts on your website. I can get you in for free if you come with me - even if I just head to the Tower and get you the tickets (I’ve been twice). The Beefeater’s tour is well worth it. There’s also a historical armour/weapon collection and the crown jewels! The royal punch bowl is my absolute favourite. Also, don’t miss the old roman wall as you come out of Tower Bridge station. </br></br>

Also great is the <strong>Victoria and Albert Museum</strong>, <strong>the Tate </strong> (some great Turner paintings), <strong>National Gallery</strong>, <strong>National Portrait Gallery </strong> and <strong>the Tate Modern</strong>. And <strong>Hampton Court Palace</strong> is quite interesting, although I’d rate Tower of London over it. It’s hard to put a foot wrong with museums really. </br></br>

<strong>Natural History Museum:</strong> the dinosaurs were cool and so was the building, but overall doesn’t top my list. </h4>

<h2> Other Stuff</h2>

<h4> <strong> The London Eye: </strong> We haven’t been on it and we want to! We walk past it every day on the way to work! </br></br>

<strong> Westminster Parliament Tour: </strong></br>
<strong> Tim: </strong> I can recommend this! It’s really good. What you don’t think about is that this is Westminster Palace. It is more epic as a Palace than either the Tower of London or Hampton Court Palace. Given you guys have an interest in politics I would highly recommend you consider a guided tour. You have to book but it’s only about 20 pounds. If you want me to do this for you I can. 
<strong> Westminster Abbey </strong> is just next door too! A beautiful cathedral, but sometimes the lines are long. </br></br>

<strong> Hyde Park</strong> and <strong>Buckingham Palace: </strong>Great to cycle around on the London Bikes. </br></br>

<strong> St Paul’s Cathedral: </strong> Very epic. If you want to be cheap you can just go for Evensong at 5.30pm for free to get a look inside rather than pay the full entry price (though that does allow you to see more). </br></br>

Other great options: <strong>Borough Markets</strong>, walking around central London, <strong> Trafalgar Square</strong>, hanging out with <strong> Tim and Sarah</strong>, checking out <strong>Harrods</strong>, walking around <strong>Greenwich Park, Observatory and town</strong>, playing games with Tim and Sar, strolling around the <strong> South Bank</strong>. </h4> 

<h2> Top Recommendations </h2>

<h4> <strong> Tim: </strong> My top two London tips for you two are probably British Museum and Westminster Houses of Parliament Tour. </br></br>

<strong> Sarah: </strong> I think a stroll or cycle from Hyde Park, past Buckingham Palace and St James’ Park, stopping off at Trafalgar Square, 10 Downing St and Whitehall, then onto Houses of Parliament, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, and a walk (or boat!) along the Thames. The views from the bridges over the Thames are nice and you could cross the river to see or go on the London Eye.  This would be a good day activity! </h4> </br>
