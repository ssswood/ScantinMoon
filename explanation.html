<h2> <strong>Tim & Sarah:</strong> Liam and Emily, our heartfelt congratulations on your wedding. We hereby present to you… your wedding present!

We thought about waiting until the wedding but given the nature of the present we want to lock it in early. So what is it? </h2>
</br>

<h3> <strong> Tim: </strong> Well... we know that you invited people to give you a memory. My initial thought was to crash your honeymoon in Paris and give you the memory of dinner at a superb one Michelin star restaurant that we went to for Sarah's 28th birthday.</h3>
</br>

<h4> <strong> Sarah:</strong> But we thought we would leave the city of love to you professionals.</h4> 
</br>

<h3> <strong> Tim: </strong> Who said I can’t be romantic with Liam and Emily? Anyway, it won’t work because you will leave Australia earlier than us!</h3>
</br>

<h4> <strong> Sarah:</strong> Instead, we have decided to give you a London experience since you will be joining us in London! </h4>
</br>

<h2> <strong>Tim & Sarah:</strong> For your wedding present we thought, what could be more London than... </h2>

<h1> Dinner &  Show!</h1>

<h2> <strong>Tim & Sarah:</strong> We would propose either Monday 5 or Tuesday 6 November for your dinner and a show. And, if you are agreeable, we would love to join you! </h2>
</br>

<h4><strong> Sarah:</strong> Of course, if you aren't interested in this then we don't want to hijack your plans with something you don't want to do. However, we think that we can offer you some tempting options. </h4>
</br>

<h3><strong> Tim: </strong>Tim: Nah, hijack! Separately, I would love to hijack your plans further if you could reserve some time on either Saturday 3 or Sunday 4th for my 30th. My birthday is on the 3rd but I’m not sure what time you arrive from Lapland on Saturday.</h3>
</br>

<h4><strong> Sarah:</strong> Back to your wedding present! In order for you to make a selection of dinner venue and show please find links to Tim & Sarah's dinner & show recommendations for you to choose from. We have cultivated a selection of culinary excellence and delightful theatre for your consideration. Should none of these options interest you or should you have other preferences feel free to go off menu.</h4>
</br>

<h3><strong> Tim: </strong> We have also made a page of London travel tips for your consideration. </h3>
</br>

<h4> <strong> Sarah:</strong> When you have selected an option please inform us. We will make all of the arrangements! </h4>
