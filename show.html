      <strong>Tim:</strong> However we wanted to give you our recommendations - divided into three categories, each ranked in order of our recommendation to you.  </br></br>

      <h2>The Classics</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>Les Miserables</li></br>
      <li>The Phantom of the Opera</li></br>
      <li>The Lion King</li></br>
      <li> Mayyybe...Wicket </li></br>
      </ol>

<h4><strong> Tim:</strong> With these top 3 classics you can’t go wrong. They are the three current longest running shows on West End, with Les Miserables having run since 1985 just pipping Phantom (1986) and the Lion King being a constant since 1999. We’ve both seen Les Mis and Lion King (though not in London) and they're amazing. Sarah has also seen Phantom of the Opera in New York and it was fab but she rates the others higher.</br> </br>

      <h2>The best of what we've seen</h2>
      <h4>

        <strong> Sarah:</strong> So far we’ve seen about 11 different shows in our time in London. The clear number 1 was a tie between was Julius Caesar at the Bridge Theatre (but alas that run has ended) and Hamilton! These are our top picks for you from what we’ve seen. </br> </br> 

        <strong> Tim:</strong></br></br>

        <strong> 1. Hamilton </strong></br>  

        The new kid on the block and the most hyped show in town is...amazing. Easily the number 1 show we’ve seen. We loved it. We have listened to the original cast recording many, many, many times so we are already converts but in some ways that does make us harsher critics. And we just loved it. It was really wonderful. We’d love to grab you tickets and send you to Hamilton because you’ll have an amazing night. It is in Victoria, not West End, this just means some of the logistics are a bit different - we might have dinner with you on a different night because they want you to be at the show an hour before and we’d recommend just doing that and getting a drink there, rather than coming from West End. Look, you could not go wrong with this choice.. </br> </br> 

        <strong> 2. The Book of Mormon </strong></br>
        You will have heard about it and maybe already seen it. It’s crazy popular and justifiably so. It’s hilarious. A stellar choice. </br> </br> 

        <strong> 2. Everybody’s Talking about Jamie </strong></br>
        This was a little out of left field. We won lottery tickets not expecting much, but it was really fantastic. A coming of age story for a high school boy. The twist: the high school boy wants to be a drag Queen. Brilliant songs, great jokes, uplifting, happy and fun. We would go again in a heartbeat. </br> </br> 

        <strong> 3. The Comedy About a Bank Robbery </strong></br>
        It’s a Comedy about a Bank Robbery. If you want comedy but not a musical, this fast-paced, slapstick, fun play is the one. I think of it as Airplane! the movie in a play. PS. If you haven’t seen Airplane! go and do that.</br> </br> 

        <strong>4. School of Rock the Musical </strong></br>
        If you liked the movie you’ll like this. I would rate it over Matilda. Fun, loud, funny and incredible kids.</br> </br> 

        We also wouldn’t recommend Aladdin. It’s great, but everything above is, in our opinion, better.

      <h2>Shakespeare</h2>
      <h4><strong> Tim:</strong> Shakespeare at The Globe is fantastic. Depending on how you want to spend your time, we feel it wouldn’t be an error to see a Shakespeare Play and a West End Show. And a Shakespeare matinee puts you on the Southbank. If you wanted to stroll along the bank and see the London Eye afterwards it would make sense. They haven’t released their schedule for when you’re here yet. The current seasons runs until August, so if you’d like we can hold off until we hear what your options are.
